**Predicting quality of an agriculture field using Data Analysis and Machine Learning**

As a part of extended coursework in Machine Learning, we developed a model to predict quality of an agricultural field by analyzing a farmers’ dataset. This project was under the guidance of Prof. Vineeth N. Balasubramanian. The implementation steps were:

◦ Conducted exploratory data analysis by analyzing data, visualizing data, and understanding the features

◦ Conducted data pre-processing by handling missing data (imputations), normalizing the dataset, and one-hot encoding categorical variables

◦ Conducted feature engineering based on correlation of features with target variable

◦ Tried different models such as XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression etc. Best performance was given by
a Random Forest.


**Details to use the model**

The code is written in the notebook attached. To run it, cd into the folder, and execute
"python es22btech11013_foml24_hackathon.py --test-file ~/test.csv --predictions-file ~/output.csv"

Check the output.csv with predictions in your home directory.
